# The Weierstrass method for finding all roots of a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials of the first order

## The linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials

The linear combination of the Chebyshev polynomials can be represented as

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>p</em> are the coefficients of the polynomial.

## The Weierstrass method

The Weierstrass method is an iterative method closely related to Newton's method for finding the roots of a polynomial. In a simplified manner, the method is brought down to the following expression:

It is important to realize, that we are not dealing with a single simple polynomial, but a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials of the first order, thus the roots are actually representable in the following way:
